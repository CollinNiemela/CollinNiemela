### Hey there, I'm Collin Niemela 👋

I'm an **AI Software Engineer** with a degree in **Computer Science & Software Engineering** from the University of Washington. I specialize in enhancing and evaluating **Large Language Models**.

Currently, I work as an **AI Prompt Engineer** at Data Annotation Tech. My focus is on improving AI-generated code by evaluating its accuracy, efficiency, and quality across multiple programming languages.

I'm especially passionate about:

- Building robust, scalable software with a focus on AI applications 🤖
- Optimizing the performance and quality of Large Language Models 🚀
- Solving complex engineering challenges to bring AI models from research to reality 🛠️

Outside of work, I still enjoy designing side projects, like an occasional game dev experiment 🎮, and I also love skiing in the winter ⛷️, golfing in the summer ⛳, and hiking on Washington's incredible mountains 🏔️.

Let’s **connect or collaborate**! I'm always open to new opportunities and learning as much as possible!
