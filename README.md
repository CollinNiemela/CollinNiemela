### Hey there, I'm Collin Niemela
My name is Collin, I'm from Washington and I enjoy game development and software engineering. I'm currently a senior at the University of Washington Bothell studying Computer Science. I recently interned as a Data Analyst and I've created numerous game and software prototypes in the past.
