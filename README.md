### Hey there, I'm Collin Niemela 👋

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a background in **Prompt Engineering** and a degree in **Computer Science & Software Engineering** from the **University of Washington**.

Right now, I work at Data Annotation Tech, where I help train large language models to understand data analysis concepts. I use technologies like **Python**, **SQL**, and **BI platforms** to work with data and design prompts that make AI think more like an analyst.

I'm especially passionate about:

- Exploring data to find insights that drive decision-making 📈
- Creating clean, interactive dashboards and reports 📊
- Designing prompts that improve AI’s understanding of data analysis 🤖

Outside of work, I still enjoy designing side projects, like an occasional game dev experiment 🎮, and I also love skiing ⛷️ in the winter, golfing in the summer, and hiking on Washington's incredible mountains 🏔️.

Let’s **connect or collaborate**! I'm always open to new opportunities and learning as much as possible!
